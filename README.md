For this project, a dataset was obtained from the Sea Scientific Open Data Publication (SEANOE), which contained recordings of underwater surface temperatures at 20-minute intervals across seven islands spanning from 2012 to 2014. The dataset provided a comprehensive and detailed record of temperature variations over time, allowing for in-depth analysis and forecasting.

Advanced time series analysis techniques were employed to analyze the dataset and forecast future underwater surface temperatures. These techniques included time series decomposition, Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models, and Holt-Winter's method, among others. Each technique offered a unique approach to capturing the underlying patterns and trends in the temperature data.

The focus of the analysis was on evaluating the performance of these forecasting models and selecting the most suitable one for predicting underwater surface temperatures accurately. Model evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were utilized to assess the predictive accuracy of each model on both training and test datasets.

Through rigorous model evaluation and comparison, it was determined that the Holt-Winter's method outperformed other models, exhibiting lower MSE and RMSE values on both training and test datasets. This demonstrated the expertise of the analyst in selecting and fine-tuning forecasting models to achieve optimal predictive performance in forecasting underwater surface temperatures.
